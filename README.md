# Airline-Customer-Satisfaction

The goal of our project is to analyze the airline customer satisfaction and provide actionable insights and help them improve their business. 

The airline industry is a highly competitive space and customer satisfaction is a key indicator of how satisfied the customers are with an airline service. It is a leading indicator of customers purchase intentions and loyalty. Unhappy or disengaged customer would naturally mean fewer passengers and less revenue. 
Since the economics of the industry is majorly dependent on customer satisfaction, it is essential to get insights into factors affecting it. The dataset provided is huge around 130,000 rows and 28 variables. The Customer Ratings are on the scale 0-5. The Data is from 14 different airlines flying in the USA. Finding the significant factors that affect the rating and how do they do it is the primary question which leads to other subqueries.

The dataset we are worked had 194833 observations of 29 variables.
